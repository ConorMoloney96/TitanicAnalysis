Analyzed and visualized data relating to the sinking of the titanic using the Business Intelligence platform Tableau.

Data was acquired from Kaggle in csv format and accessed from my local machine by tableau. Tableau Cloud can also be used to access data stored remotely.

The dashboard I created consisted of 4 graphs. The aim of these graphs was to visualize how different factors (features in the terminology of 
machine learning or 'Dimension' in Tableau impacted the survival rates of the passengers.

Each graph shows the number of survivors grouped by features in terms of both total numbers and percentages of total population. 

Some key insights from the data were that passengers under the age of 10 were most likely to survive. Passengers in 1st class were also 
more likely to survive than those in the other classes with a 66% survival rate. In total 38.38% survived while 61.62% did not.

Using Tableau for this project made both exploring the data to identify relevant features and visualising this data in an easy to understand 
format extremely easy. Showing why Tableau is such a highly valued tool for data analysis and business intelligence.
